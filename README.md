### This directory contains a minimal skeleton for creating a Helm chart.
This is meant as a minium base for creating a functioning Helm chart.
Look for TODO's in each of the files to see what you have to do.

See the [Uninett Helm chart repo](https://github.com/UNINETT/helm-charts/) for inspiration.
#### TODO (after all other TODOs): remove the section above.

## TODO: Add your chart name here
TODO: Write a high-level description of what this chart does and, if relevant, how
to use it.

### Advanced
TODO: A links to all docker files used to build the docker images used in this chart.
